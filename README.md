===================
Welcome to the Random Coder project. The goal of this project is to provide
solutions to common software develpment problems. Predominantly, this includes
Java and related web technologies, because that is where I spend most of my
time.

Much of what you find here and in the associated randomcoder libraries is
code that I find myself writing and re-writing for nearly every project I
work on. My hope is that others may be able to use my "wheels" without
re-inventing their own.

Great effort has been expended to clean up this code and present it in a form
which should be generally usable by anyone. I am open to contributions, both
in source and verbal form, which improve the quality and feature set of this
code.
